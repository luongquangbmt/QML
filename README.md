## Personal Quantum Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a my own implementation ofquantum machine learning pipeline.
At this moment, it includes:
- quantum data encoding 
- QGAN
Note that it is not working with qiskit >v2.0 yet

### Structure
- `notebooks/`: Contains the original Jupyter notebook for quantum data encoding.

### Getting Started
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the main training pipeline:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

### Dependencies
See `requirements.txt` for full details.
